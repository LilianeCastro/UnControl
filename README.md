## Description

The Darkness wants to corrupt the Light

The Light wants to purify the darkness

Keep the balance of forces by purging the invaders.

The guardian on each side loses control, and the other guardian takes over protecting his side.

Switch between sides to purify or corrupt the largest number of invaders.
